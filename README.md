- ~~on the SetSeparationOnEachCommand I need to include the user procedures to also make separations. the best bet is make a list (possible global) with all de starndard & user commands and do a foreach to make the separation~~
- ~~the variables on procedures should be declared as :<varname> instead of <varname>~~

Turtle sprite is a little canvas (.turtle) which contains a poly (turtle). I use a function to rotate the poly obtained from tcl wiki
To move the sprite I use the "place configure" of the turtle canvas
