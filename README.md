# TODO

- ~~on the SetSeparationOnEachCommand I need to include the user procedures to also make separations. the best bet is make a list (possible global) with all de starndard & user commands and do a foreach to make the separation~~
- the variables on procedures should be declared as :<varname> instead of <varname>
